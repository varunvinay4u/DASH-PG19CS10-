            <h1>Lesson 10 - Actions</h1>  
            <p>An action is something that we do consciously or unconsciously to achieve a specific outcome or purpose.
            In the context of daily life, actions are the behaviors or activities that people engage in as part of their routine or daily habits.
            These actions can be physical, such as walking or typing, or mental, such as thinking or decision-making. 
            Examples of daily actions include waking up, brushing teeth, eating breakfast, going to work, doing chores, exercising, and sleeping. 
            These actions are often repeated regularly, forming habits and routines that shape our daily lives.</p>
            <h2>Run</h2>
            <p> We could define "run" as a way of moving quickly on two feet. Running involves moving your legs back and forth quickly, like when you're playing tag or racing your friends. It's faster than walking but not as fast as jumping or flying.</p>
    
            <p>You might run to get some exercise, to play a game, or just because it's fun. It's important to remember that we should only run in safe places and with adult supervision, so we don't accidentally bump into anyone or hurt ourselves.</p>

            </div> 
            <h2>Dance</h2>
            <p> We could define "dance" as a fun way of moving your body to music. Dancing involves using your arms, legs, and hips to make different shapes and movements that match the rhythm of the music. You can dance alone or with friends, and there are many different styles of dance like ballet, hip-hop, and tap. </p>
    
            <p>When you dance, you can express yourself and show how the music makes you feel. Dancing is a great way to exercise, have fun, and be creative!</p>

            </div> 
            <h2>Eat</h2>
            <p>  We could define "eat" as the action of putting food into your mouth, biting it with your teeth, and swallowing it into your stomach. Eating is important because it gives our bodies the energy and nutrients we need to grow and stay healthy. We eat many different types of food, like fruits, vegetables, bread, meat, and cheese. </p>
            <p> It's important to eat a variety of foods so we can get all the nutrients we need. We should also try to eat slowly and chew our food well, so it's easier to swallow and digest. When we're finished eating, we should clean up our plates and put away any leftover food to avoid wasting it.
            </p>

                <br>
            </div> 
            <h2>Drink</h2>
            <p>  We could define "drink" as the action of taking a liquid into your mouth and swallowing it into your stomach. Drinking is important because it helps keep our bodies hydrated and healthy. We drink many different types of liquids, like water, milk, juice, and soup. It's important to drink enough water every day to keep our bodies hydrated, especially when we're playing or exercising.</p>
            <p> When we're finished drinking, we should put our cup or glass away and clean up any spills to avoid accidents. It's also important to remember that we should only drink liquids that are safe for us to consume, and always ask an adult if we're not sure.
            </p>

            </div> 
            <h2>Sing</h2>
            <p>  We could define "sing" as making musical sounds with your voice. When you sing, you use your mouth and throat to make different pitches and rhythms, like when you're singing a song or a nursery rhyme. Singing is a fun way to express yourself and make music with your own voice</p>
            <p> You can sing alone or with friends, and there are many different types of songs you can sing, like happy songs, silly songs, and lullabies. When you sing, you can use your body to show how the music makes you feel, like by clapping your hands or moving your arms. It's important to remember to be respectful of others who are singing and to have fun!
