            <h1>Lesson 10 - Actions</h1>  
            <p>An action is something that we do consciously or unconsciously to achieve a specific outcome or purpose.
            In the context of daily life, actions are the behaviors or activities that people engage in as part of their routine or daily habits.
            These actions can be physical, such as walking or typing, or mental, such as thinking or decision-making. 
            Examples of daily actions include waking up, brushing teeth, eating breakfast, going to work, doing chores, exercising, and sleeping. 
            These actions are often repeated regularly, forming habits and routines that shape our daily lives.</p>
            
            <h2>Run</h2>
            <p> We could define "run" as a way of moving quickly on two feet. Running involves moving your legs back and forth quickly, like when you're playing tag or racing your friends. It's faster than walking but not as fast as jumping or flying.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/Run.jpg" alt="Run" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p>You might run to get some exercise, to play a game, or just because it's fun. It's important to remember that we should only run in safe places and with adult supervision, so we don't accidentally bump into anyone or hurt ourselves.</p>
           
            <h2>Dance</h2>
            <p> We could define "dance" as a fun way of moving your body to music. Dancing involves using your arms, legs, and hips to make different shapes and movements that match the rhythm of the music. You can dance alone or with friends, and there are many different styles of dance like ballet, hip-hop, and tap. </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/Dance.jpg" alt="Dance" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p>When you dance, you can express yourself and show how the music makes you feel. Dancing is a great way to exercise, have fun, and be creative!</p>
             
            <h2>Eat</h2>
            <p> We could define "eat" as the action of putting food into your mouth, biting it with your teeth, and swallowing it into your stomach. Eating is important because it gives our bodies the energy and nutrients we need to grow and stay healthy. We eat many different types of food, like fruits, vegetables, bread, meat, and cheese. </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/eat.jpg" alt="Eat" width="400" height="300">
            </div> 
             <p> It's important to eat a variety of foods so we can get all the nutrients we need. We should also try to eat slowly and chew our food well, so it's easier to swallow and digest. When we're finished eating, we should clean up our plates and put away any leftover food to avoid wasting it.
            </p>
          
            <h2>Drink</h2>      
            <p> We could define "drink" as the action of taking a liquid into your mouth and swallowing it into your stomach. Drinking is important because it helps keep our bodies hydrated and healthy. We drink many different types of liquids, like water, milk, juice, and soup. It's important to drink enough water every day to keep our bodies hydrated, especially when we're playing or exercising.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/drink.jpg" alt="Drink" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p> When we're finished drinking, we should put our cup or glass away and clean up any spills to avoid accidents. It's also important to remember that we should only drink liquids that are safe for us to consume, and always ask an adult if we're not sure.
            </p>
             
            <h2>Sing</h2>
            <p> We could define "sing" as making musical sounds with your voice. When you sing, you use your mouth and throat to make different pitches and rhythms, like when you're singing a song or a nursery rhyme. Singing is a fun way to express yourself and make music with your own voice</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/Sing.jpg" alt="Sing" width="400" height="300">
            </div> 
            <p> You can sing alone or with friends, and there are many different types of songs you can sing, like happy songs, silly songs, and lullabies. When you sing, you can use your body to show how the music makes you feel, like by clapping your hands or moving your arms. It's important to remember to be respectful of others who are singing and to have fun!</p>
            
            <h2>Cry</h2>          
            <p> We could define "cry" as the action of shedding tears when you feel sad or upset. When you cry, your eyes produce tears that come out of your eyes and roll down your face. Sometimes you might also make sounds with your mouth, like sobbing or sniffing. It's okay to cry when you're feeling sad, angry, or frustrated.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/cry.jpg" alt="Cry" width="400" height="300">
            </div> 
            <p>Crying can help us feel better by releasing our emotions and letting others know that we need comfort or support. When you see someone crying, it's important to be kind and offer them a hug or words of comfort to help them feel better.</p>
            
            <h2>Handshake</h2>
            <p> We could define "handshake" as a way of greeting someone by shaking their hand with your own. When we shake hands, we extend our right hand towards the other person's right hand and briefly grasp it up and down. Handshakes are a polite way to say hello or introduce yourself to someone new. It's important to shake hands gently and use a friendly tone of voice when saying hello.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/handshaking.jpg" alt="Handshake" width="400" height="300">
            </div> 
            <p>When we're finished shaking hands, we can let go and smile to show that we're happy to meet the other person. However, it's important to remember that some people may prefer not to shake hands or use other greetings, and we should always respect their wishes.</p>
            
            <h2>Talk</h2>
            <p> We could define "talk" as the action of using your voice to communicate with others. When we talk, we use words and sentences to express our thoughts, feelings, and ideas. We talk to our friends, family, and teachers to share stories, ask questions, or tell them how we feel. It's important to speak clearly and loudly enough so that others can hear us, but not too loudly that it becomes uncomfortable for others.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/talk.jpg" alt="Talk" width="400" height="300">
            </div> 
            <p>We should also be respectful and polite when we talk to others, and listen carefully to what they have to say. When we're finished talking, we can say goodbye or thank you to show that we appreciate the conversation.</p>
            
            <h2>Fight</h2>
            <p> We could define "fight" as a physical or verbal conflict between two or more people. When people fight, they may push, hit, or yell at each other. Fighting is not a good way to solve problems or disagreements, and it's important to find other ways to resolve conflicts without hurting others. </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/fight.jpg" alt="Fight" width="400" height="300">
            </div> 
            <p>Instead of fighting, we can talk about our feelings, share our opinions, and find ways to compromise or work together to solve problems. If we see other people fighting, it's important to tell an adult who can help them find a peaceful solution.</p>
           
            <h2>Clap</h2>
            <p> We could define "clap" as the action of bringing your hands together to make a loud noise. When we clap, we can express our appreciation, excitement, or happiness for something. We can clap our hands in many different ways, like by clapping slowly, clapping quickly, or clapping rhythmically to music.  </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/clap.jpg" alt="Clap" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p>Clapping is a fun way to show our support for others, like when we see a performance, hear a story, or celebrate an achievement. When we're finished clapping, we can stop and smile to show that we enjoyed what we saw or heard.</p>
            
            <h2>Hug</h2>
            <p>We could define "hug" as an action of wrapping your arms around someone to show them love or affection. When we hug someone, we use our arms to gently squeeze the other person's body. Hugging can make us feel happy, safe, and loved. We hug our family, friends, and pets to show them that we care about them.  </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/hug.jpg" alt="Hug" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p> It's important to ask for permission before hugging someone, and to respect their wishes if they don't want to be hugged. We should also be gentle when we hug, and not squeeze too tightly or for too long. When we're finished hugging, we can smile and say something kind to the other person to show that we appreciate them.</p>
          
            <h2>Bath</h2>
            <p>We could define "bath" as a way of cleaning your body by sitting or standing in a tub or shower filled with water. When we take a bath, we use soap and water to wash our skin and hair, and to remove dirt and sweat from our bodies.Baths can be relaxing and fun, and we can add bubbles or toys to make them more enjoyable. </p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/bath.jpg" alt="Bath" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p>It's important to always have an adult present when taking a bath to ensure safety. After taking a bath, we dry ourselves with a towel and put on clean clothes to feel fresh and clean.</p>
          
            <h2>Jump</h2>
            <p>We could define "jump" as the action of pushing off the ground with your feet and leaving the ground briefly. When we jump, we use our legs to push ourselves up into the air, and then we land back on the ground. Jumping can be a fun way to play and exercise, and we can jump in many different ways, like jumping high, jumping far, or jumping over obstacles.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="image/jump.jpg" alt="Jump" width="400" height="300">
            </div>
            <p>It's important to make sure we have enough space to jump safely, and to land on a soft surface like grass or a mat. When we're finished jumping, we can smile and feel proud of ourselves for having fun and being active.</p>
