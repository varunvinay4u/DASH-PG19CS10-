<h1>Shapes</h1>
			<p>Today we will learn about different shapes and their properties. Shapes are all around us and understanding them is important for many different activities.</p>
			
<h2>Circle</h2>
			<p>A circle is a shape with all points at the same distance from its center. It is a two-dimensional shape and has no angles.</p>

<h2>Square</h2>
			<p>A square is a four-sided shape with all sides equal and all angles right angles. It is also a two-dimensional shape.</p>
			<img src="image/square.png" alt="Square">
<h2>Triangle</h2>
			<p>A triangle is a three-sided shape. There are different types of triangles based on their sides and angles.</p>

<h2>Rectangle</h2>
			<p>A rectangle is a four-sided shape with opposite sides equal and parallel. It is also a two-dimensional shape.</p>
			<img src="image/rectangle.jpeg" alt="Rectangle">
<h2>Pentagon</h2>
			<p>A pentagon is a five-sided shape. It is also a two-dimentional shape.</p>

<h1>3 Dimentional Shapes</h1>
			<p>Now let us familiarise with some 3 Dimensional shapes.</p>
<h2>Cube</h2>
			<p>Cube is a solid three-dimensional figure, which has 6 square faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges.</p>
			<img src="image/cube.jpeg" alt="Cube">
<h2>Cuboid</h2>
			<p>Cuboid is a solid which has six rectangular faces at right angles to each other.</p>
			<img src="image/cuboid.jpeg" alt="Cuboid">
<h2>Sphere</h2>
			<p>A sphere is a three-dimensional object that is round in shape.</p>
			<p>The points on the surface of the sphere are equidistant from the center. Hence, the distance between the center and the surface of the sphere are equal at any point.</p>

<h2>Cylinder</h2>
			<p>a cylinder is a three-dimensional solid that holds two parallel bases joined by a curved surface, at a fixed distance.</p>
