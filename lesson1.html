		<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Colors</h1>
		<p>In this lesson, we will learn about the basic colors.</p>
		<section>
			<h2>What are Colors?</h2>
			<p>Colors are what we see all around us! The sky is blue, the grass is green, and the sun is yellow. There are many different colors like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and black.</p>
			<p>Colors can also help us to identify things. For example, when you see a stop sign, you know that it is red and that you should stop. Or when you see a banana, you know that it is yellow and that it is ripe and ready to eat!</p>
