Today we will learn about different shapes and their properties. Shapes are all around us and understanding them is important for many different activities.

A circle is a shape with all points at the same distance from its center. It is a two-dimensional shape and has no angles.
---

A square is a four-sided shape with all sides equal and all angles right angles. It is also a two-dimensional shape.
---

A triangle is a three-sided shape. There are different types of triangles based on their sides and angles.
---

A rectangle is a four-sided shape with opposite sides equal and parallel. It is also a two-dimensional shape.
---

A pentagon is a five-sided shape. It is also a two-dimentional shape.
---

3D shapes have three different measures such as length, width, and height as its dimensions. The only difference between 2D shape and 3D shapes is that 2D shapes do not have a thickness or depth.
Usually, 3D shapes are obtained from the rotation of the 2D shapes. The faces of the solid shapes are the 2D shapes.

Cube is a solid three-dimensional figure, which has 6 square faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges.
---

Cuboid is a solid which has six rectangular faces at right angles to each other.
---

A sphere is a three-dimensional object that is round in shape.
The points on the surface of the sphere are equidistant from the center. Hence, the distance between the center and the surface of the sphere are equal at any point.

A cylinder is a three-dimensional solid that holds two parallel bases joined by a curved surface, at a fixed distance.

A cone is a solid object that has a circular base and has a single vertex. It is a geometrical shape that tapers smoothly from the circular flat base to a point called the apex.
